# Sha2-rs
Self learning and didactic implementation of the sha256 algorithm.

## About
This project is an improved version of my original SHA-256 implementation, written in a more idiomatic and readable Rust style.
While it is still far from the performance of production-grade implementations like GNU's one, Iâ€™m proud of my version. Looking for optimizing in the future.

## Usage
```sh
cargo run --release -- [path]
```

## Requirements
- [rustc](https://www.rust-lang.org/) >= 1.80.0
